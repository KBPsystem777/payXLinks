# 🚀 BPxPay - payXLinks

> The fastest way to get paid in crypto. No apps. No friction. Just links.

https://pay.bpxai.com

BPxPayLink is a crypto-native payment link platform. It lets anyone generate a unique URL to request stablecoin payments (like USDC/USDT), share it with a payer, and withdraw the funds securely — all through a simple, smart-contract-backed flow.
